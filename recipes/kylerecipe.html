			<h2>Chocolate Biscuit Cake</h2>
			by Kyle Richard
			<h3>Ingredients</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>1/2 teaspoon butter, for greasing the pan</li>
				<li>8 ounces Rich tea biscuits or sweet cookies</li>
                <li>4 ounces unsalted butter, softened</li>
                <li>4 ounces granulated sugar</li>
                <li>4 ounces dark chocolate</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>8 ounces dark chocolate, for coating</li>
                <li>1 ounce chocolate, for decoration</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Lightly grease a 6-inch-by-2Â½-inch cake
                    ring with the butter and place on a tray 
                    on a sheet of parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Break each of the biscuits into almond size
                    pieces by hand and set aside.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the butter and sugar 
                    until the mixture starts to lighten.</li>
                <li>4. Melt the 4 ounces of the dark chocolate and 
                    add to the butter mixture, stirring constantly.</li>
                <li>Add the egg and beat to combine.</li>
                <li>Fold in the biscuit pieces until they are all 
                    coated with the chocolate mixture.</li>
                <li>Spoon the mixture into the prepared cake ring. 
                    Try to fill all of the gaps on the bottom of the 
                    ring because this will be the top when it is un-molded.</li>
                <li>Chill the cake in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours.</li>
                <li>Remove the cake from the refrigerator and let it stand.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, melt the 8 ounces of dark chocolate in a double boiler 
                    or saucepan on the stove top over low heat. Slide the ring off the cake 
                    and turn it upside down onto a cake wire.</li>
                <li>Pour the melted chocolate over the cake and smooth the top and sides 
                    using a palette knife.</li>
                <li>Allow the chocolate to set at room temperature.</li>
                <li>Carefully run a knife around the bottom of the cake where the 
                    chocolate has stuck it to the cake wire and lift it onto a tea plate.</li>
                <li>Melt the remaining 1 ounce of chocolate and use to decorate the top of the cake.</li>
            </ol>
