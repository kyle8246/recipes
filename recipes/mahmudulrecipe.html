                <ul>
                    <li>1 1/2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra to drizzle</li>
                    <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
                    <li>250g mixed wild mushrooms such as shiitake and oyster, sliced if large</li>
                    <li>250g Swiss brown mushrooms, sliced</li>
                    <li>100g baby spinach leaves</li>
                    <li>1/2 lemon, juiced</li>
                    <li>2 (15cm each) bought pizza bases</li>
                    <li>125g soft goats' cheese</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp chopped fresh chives</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Directions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 200Â°C.</li>
                    <li>Place olive oil in a frying pan over high heat. When it is very hot, add garlic and mushrooms
                        and cook quickly until mushrooms are just wilted but not releasing any liquid.
                        Add the spinach and lemon juice and allow spinach to just wilt.</li>
                    <li>Season with salt and cracked black pepper, then remove from heat.</li>
                    <li>Spread the pizza bases with goats' cheese and place on a baking tray.</li>
                    <li>Pile the mushroom mixture on top and drizzle with a little more oil.
                        Bake in oven for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with chives to serve and a dollop of creme fraiche, if
                        desired.</li>
